## Additional Recommendations

1. **Unit Testing**: Implement comprehensive unit tests for the `PowerCalculator` class to validate its functionality across various scenarios, including edge cases. Utilize JUnit for writing these tests.
2. **Code Formatting**: Adopt a consistent code formatting style across the project. Tools like [Google Java Format](https://github.com/google/google-java-format) can automate this process.
3. **Continuous Integration**: Set up a CI pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions) to automatically build and test the project on commits and pull requests.
4. **Dependency Management**: Review the `build.gradle` and `libs.versions.toml` files to ensure all dependencies are up-to-date and necessary.
5. **Enhanced Documentation**: Expand the documentation to include usage examples, contributing guidelines, and detailed explanations of the code architecture to aid future developers.
6. **Exception Handling in `MainMethod`**: Modify the `MainMethod` to handle potential exceptions thrown by the `PowerCalculator` class gracefully, ensuring the program does not terminate unexpectedly.

By implementing these recommendations, the project will not only be more robust and maintainable but also adhere to best practices in software development.
